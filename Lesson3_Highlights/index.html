            <p class="lead">Git comes from humble beginnings just like most things in the software web community. To understand git one has to understand the history of Linux as an open source extremely customizable operating system. So git as a Linux kernel is a similar concept with open sourced software project in a large scale. Beginning in the early 90â€™s it has been building a bigger and better kernel ever since. In 2005 things changed a little with some business changes and a new system was created to faster, more simple, Fully distributed, and able to handle bigger projects. Even through the changes over time git has retained its initial qualities. </p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a component of software management that focuses on revision and source controls. In regards to web apps it is important to understand version control in the context of large websites that collect or manage large amounts of information. A VCS (Version control system) usually an outside application to that of the main web application. It is in charge of keeping track of revisions. The best example comes in the form of Wikipedia. As an open site that anyone can edit keeping track of past versions of a site is crucial to the sites integrity. In their case someone could delete important information that would need to be found in a previous version.</p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has two types of repositories local and remote. The first one local is for changes that are made locally normally located on our own machines instead of a remote server this makes the system faster and easier to use. In local all the changes and branches made to the repository are kept on that repository since it was created.</p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Remote repositories are mainly used in Git for collaboration on projects. The basics concept of a remote repository is versions of the project that you are working on that are being hosted on the internet or through a network. Since they are being shared managing permissions on remote repository is key. These are read-only or read/write. This is important to remember when security or the integrity of work is important.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a VCS (version control system). Git takes what it likes to call snap shots of a file system. Every time a user commits or saves the state of a project in git its taking a snap shot of what has been created or changed. If a commit is trying to be made and nothing has changed git will not store the file again, but just a link to the previous identical file that is already stored.</p>
